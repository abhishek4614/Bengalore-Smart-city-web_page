   Gandhiji has exemplified the message that we ought to be the change we wish to see and the idea of Cleanliness is Godliness. In the context of Sustainable Mobility and improving Public Architecture, Bengaluru Smart City is collaborating with BBMP, Directorate of Urban Land Transport, Bengaluru City and Traffic Police, Karnataka State Reserve Police, the stakeholders in the city for improving the Mobility Infrastructure.

   The ABD area of Bengaluru Smart City is identified as a cycling district in the making 2 months back with a joint understanding between the Directorate of Urban Land Transport and the Bengaluru Smart City. Cycling infrastructure of 5 kilometres length is targeted to be ready before the 1st of November, 2020 and 25 kilometres by the end of this year.

   It may be noted that the Smart Cities Mission, MoHUA is emphasising on the

post-COVID-19 Sustainable Mobility Planning by more focus on the local

commute and emphasising on the increase of use of non-motorized transport. The Ride by 150 Cyclists is also to emphasize on Garbage free roads, maintaining and keeping public spaces cleaner, identifying pain points/ dead spaces and restoring them, and creating a more liveable Namma Bengaluru.

   The Ride for Peace or Ride against Road Violence shall commence at 7:30 am on 2nd October 2020 at the East Gate of the Vidhan Soudha and move towards the Mahatma Gandhi road via the Cubbon Park. Kindly join this event as we pedal for peace with physical distancing and focus on the behavioural change demanded by the pandemic situation we are in, starting this Gandhi Jayanthi.

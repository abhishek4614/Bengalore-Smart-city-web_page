<h1>BBMP COVID-19 War Room </h1>
<p>
Bengaluru Smart City Limited (BSCL) and Bengaluru City Municipal Corporation set up the Strategic Operations Command Center called as BBMP COVID-19 War Room on 22nd March 2020, to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Data management and integration have become effective with the quick intervention of the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India, in its endeavor to help cities leverage technologies for handling the cities in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

<a id="display_123" href="javascript:toggle('123');">More Text</a>
<br />
<div id="toggle_123" style="display: none"><p> It is appreciated that with the technical support and platform to collaborate, Bengaluru Smart City is making the efforts outcome-oriented in terms of comprehensive city-level planning and preparedness and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic with the use of technology at Bengaluru, a major metropolitan city with close to 13 million population. &nbsp; &nbsp;
<h3 style="color: rgb(223, 42, 10);"> In this context, Bengaluru War Room has developed an application called Index Application  which helps to access the information on COVID-19 Positive Cases from the ICMR portal, provides the user interface to the Zonal Command Centers.</h3><p> And all field teams for action and implementation of tasks and has significantly reduced the time taken from 24 hours to near real-time for monitoring at the BBMP.</p>

<p> The Index Application allows for a smooth transition of information to the zones for action. Zonal Command Centers also have a dashboard with localized information on the respective zones. The app is custom-made for Bengaluru (BBMP) with inputs from the Actual Users monitoring various tasks related to the COVID-19 crisis management. The implementation and rollout happened in real-time immediately and the application was developed in-house.</p>
</p>
</div>

<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<p>
The Index Application has enhanced the effectiveness of the city administration in managing the COVID-19 situation. With constant improvement and efforts in the direction to provide situational awareness in near-to real-time, it facilitates as a decision support system for operations management and timely dissemination of information to the city stakeholders.

<a id="display_2234" href="javascript:toggle('2234');">More Text</a>
<br />
<div id="toggle_2234" style="display: none"> <p> The Index Application is under constant improvement with effective coordination during implementation and understanding of field-level scenarios as they emerge in this dynamic management exercise being attempted by the cities.</p> 
<p> The Application is very critical as the reduction in the response time from 24 hours to less than 1 hour at the critical stage after the updation of the data about the results of testing on the ICMR portal has a direct implication on the identification and shifting of the patients to respective health facilities. This application, goes as an innovation of the Bengaluru Smart City, as it has significantly reduced the time taken from 24 hours to near real-time for accessing the information on COVID-19 Positive Cases for action by the zones, including shifting of the patient to either hospital or CCC based on symptoms, arranging ambulances, tracking patient lifecycle, etc.</p>

<p> In a way, an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic management at the field level will substantiate that an intervention like this at the critical juncture helps in reducing fatalities and resolves distress situations and thus, is very relevant for the cities and states to replicate or adopt in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

      <h2 class="txt-center h1">ECONOMY</h2>
      <p class="responsive-p">Bengaluru was established as a trade town in 1537 owing to its central location and connectivity. It has not only retained that, but grown leaps and bounds beyond, including national and global economy and connectivity, along with being the capital of the state. <br>
        The city got railways connectivity in 1860s, which led to large public works and migration. The Bangalore Woollen factory was started in 1870s.It was the first city to get electricity, and there are many such firsts associated to the city. <br>
        In the post-independence era, the state was the centre for Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) like ITI, HMT (1953), Aircraft (HAL - 1963), BEML, BEL, BHEL and other defence and government undertakings with dedicated townships. Along with these, private industries like pharmaceuticals, textiles, electronics, glassware, agricultural implements, food processing, paper, watches, etc have flourished. Sandalwood products, agarbattis and small cottage industries also used to be a part of the trade. <br>
        (The establishment of industrial estate known as Electronics City in 1977 had much effect on the later growth of the city in terms of rate of spatial expansion and population. The Department of Electronics developed the ‘Software Technology Parks of India scheme’ (STPIs) to provide infrastructure for software production which was purely meant for exports and to attract ‘offshore software production’ One of the initial six STPIs was set up at the Electronics City.) <br>
        In the 1990s, post economic liberalisation, there was a boom of IT and influx of Multinational corporations. (United States Agency for International Development (USAID) aided Bangalore to become a high technology centre in a model like Silicon Valley, offering opportunities for expanding Indo-U.S. business contacts). <br>
        Domestic firms like Infosys, Wipro are headquartered in Bengaluru. This Silicon Valley of India has 100s of It companies of largest to smallest hubs. This has led to an unprecedented growth in the last 25 years. It is home to several Prestigious Educational Institutions, Research based innovations hubs like Indian Institute of Science (1909), the Raman Research Institute (1943), the National Aeronautical Research Laboratory (1960), and a division of the National Power Research Institute (1960).
        The city has morphed from a sleepy pensioners paradise to a vibrant young phenomenon which is continuously changing and reforming itself.
        Bengaluru is now one of the fastest growing Metropolitans in the world.</p>

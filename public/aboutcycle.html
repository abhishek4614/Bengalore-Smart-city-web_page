        > The pandemic has forced the cities to look at alternatives with regard to sustainable modes of transportation. The challenge aims to help cities connect with their citizens as well as experts to develop a unified vision and initiatives to promote cycling across the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are various measures that the cities can adopt to increase the cycling initiatives in their domain. Some of these measures are:
        <ul>
            •	Creating extensive cycling-networks through low-cost interventions like pop-up cycle lanes and traffic-calmed or non-motorised zones,
        </ul>
    <ul>
        •	Launching programmes such as community-led cycle rental schemes that increase the availability of cycles to citizens.
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
       * Promoting the usage of cycling through public events and outreach.
    </ul>
    
    </p>
    <p>
        In the long run the Smart Cities Mission encourages cities to convert temporary interventions into permanent ones.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The India Programme of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) will be the knowledge partner of the Smart Cities Mission to assist the Mission in conducting this challenge and guiding cities in developing and implementing their proposals.
    </p>
     
    <p>* In case of any questions, the nodal officer from the city can write to :</p>
    <h3>contact@cycles4change.org</h3>
    <p>* The common questions received will be answered on the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page of the competition website.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    The need for personalised forms of transport is expected to increase as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent survey by the ITDP India Programme shows that cycling would increase by 50-65% as cities come out of lockdown. This is corroborated by the actual response on the ground with a sudden spike in the usage of cycles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cycling can be a sustainable alternative to private motor vehicles. Cycling provides equal access to jobs, education, recreation, and other everyday activities for all sections of society – rich, poor, children, women, and others. By making streets safe for cycling, cities can dramatically increase the share of this green and healthy form of transport and recreation.
</p>
<p>
    Cities around the world are leveraging the  opportunity  to  expand  their  cycling networks and Public Bicycle Sharing (PBS) systems
    <ul>
        •	Paris is creating 650km of pop- up cycleways. 
    </ul>
<ul>
    •	PBS systems in Beijing alone saw users rise by roughly 150%.  
</ul>

<ul>
   * Promoting the usage of cycling through public events and outreach.
</ul>

</p>
<p>
    Increasing cycling can help cities in a green economic recovery. Investments in cycling infrastructure have economic benefits of up to 5.5 times the initial investment. Cycling for short distances can result in an annual benefit of INR 1.8 trillion to the Indian economy.It also has the potential of increasing personal fuel savings by over INR 27 billion. 
</p>
<p>
    Cities must prioritise urban resilience through sustainable and equitable transportation to overcome this current crisis and to be better poised to face the future. <h4>It is now
    imperative, that Indian cities start creating a cycling-friendly environment to encourage people to use this eco-friendly and healthy mode of transport and ensure that people can access jobs, education, and essential services safely.</h4>
